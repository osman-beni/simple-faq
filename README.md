### What I learned

While working on this project, I deepened my understanding of building accessible and responsive user interfaces using modern web technologies. I learned how to structure semantic HTML for better accessibility. Additionally, I gained experience in applying utility-first CSS with Tailwind to speed up styling and maintain consistency. This project also helped me improve my problem-solving skills by breaking down UI requirements into manageable components and ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Essential for learning utility-first CSS and best practices.
